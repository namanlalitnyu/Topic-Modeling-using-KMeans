In the present study we have attempted to solve the problem of accelerated transmutation of another very dangerous radioactive Sr90 isotope. This paper presents the results of investigation of the nuclear reaction Sr88 + p = Y89 a transmutation to a stable Sr88 analog of radioactive Sr90 isotope. The research was carried out on the basis of optimal anaerobic syntrophic associations under the stimulated long-distant action of weak undamped thermal waves. © 2022 ICCF. All rights reserved.

1,"['Nickel Transmutation and Excess Heat Model using Reversible Thermodynamics This research develops the Least Action Nuclear Process (LANP) model of cold fusion, by assuming that the process is thermody- namically reversible. This requires: (1) one element of new physical theory, a far-from-equilibrium black body equation having a second temperature scale and (2) a nuclear reaction selection method based on the Principle of Least Action. The model appears to predict nuclear transmutations observed in Miley’s nickel microspheres, without false positives, and provides a plausible explanation of loading and ignition processes, excess heat, no excess heat, and the absence of gamma radiation. The model shows how solar core temperatures can exist in a laboratory temperature device. This presentation is abstracted from a larger technical paper. © 2014 ISCMNS. All rights reserved.

When the agent capturing the di-neutron is 1H, tritium is the result. When it is 2H, 4He and heat ↓ ↑ → are the products (the Fleishmann Pons Heat Effect). Consistent with the tendency of di-neutrons to cluster, multiple di-neutrons are occasionally captured yielding neutron heavy nuclei. This is followed by beta decay and the respective isotonic products. We show that, within the PdD matrix, these di-neutron reactions involve phonon enforced quantum tunneling. The di-neutron-phonon mech- anism fully accounts for the following: (1) the evolved heat commensurate with 4He production, (2) the production of tritium when small amounts of 1H are present, (3) the release of feeble neutrons, (4) the formation of Pr when Cs is present, (5) the ostensive intermittent reproducibility and erratic (chaotic) heat out-puts, and (6) the seemingly major problem of obfuscating the Coulombic repulsion issue. Indeed, the antics of the di-neutron can fully explain the important aspects of normal temperature LENR heat effects and transmutations. Further, the di-neutron paradigm (mechanism) falls within the normal bounds of the Standard Model, and it is without the necessity of exotic forms of matter. c 2019 ISCMNS. All rights reserved.

This paper deals with the palladium–deuteride (PdD) structure that is generally modeled with a deuterium-to-helium (D + D 4He) cold-fusion process. ⇒ How this process results in transmutation is based on the extended-lochon model that predicts deep-orbit electrons that are tightly bound to the 4He nucleus and thus make the equivalent of a neutralized alpha particle. This model is compared with the NiH system (H + H D, H##, or 2H#) described earlier and distinguishes long-range from short-range transmutation (distance from the fusion ⇒ 2 site) as well as the relative excess energies from fusion vs. transmutation. The model predicts the probable transmutation process(es) and products in the palladium system and explains other observed results of cold-fusion experiments. © 2015 ISCMNS. All rights reserved.

2,"['Integrated approach for high resolution surface characterization: coupling focused ion beam with micro and nano mechanical tests. In the present paper, we will give a brief overview about the synergic use of two high resolution techniques with focus on applications on thin coatings: Focused Ion Beam (coupled with electron beam) imaging, milling and deposition technique (briefly called FIB) and Nanoindentation. After a basic description of both techniques (architecture, probe-sample interaction basics and operation modes), we will demonstrate effectiveness of this approach for microstructural investigation on very small samples without any sample preparation or pre- processing by presenting two case studies: (i) Analysis of residual stresses of engineered surfaces by coupling focused ion beam controlled material removal and nanoindentation testing, and (ii) Nano-mechanical characterization of sputtered niobium thin films for application in accelerating cavities.', 'Searching for excess heat in Mizuno-type plasma electrolysis Excess heat generated in the glow discharge plasma electrolysis, first reported by Mizuno and Ohmori (1), has been studied by several researchers, both in Japan (2, 3, 4) and in other countries (5, 6, 7, 8). Most reports, but not all, confirmed generation of excess heat. Facing this situation we decided to replicate the most recent experiment (8) in which excess heat was reported to increase with voltage. Our results do not confirm reality of excess heat.', 'Electromagnetic Emission in the kHz to GHz Range Associated with Heat Production During Electrochemical Loading of Deuterium into Palladium: A Summary and Analysis of Results Obtained by Different Research Groups There is a small literature on the combination of low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) experiments and radiofrequencies (RF). The papers are worth attention in case they can teach anything about the mechanisms behind LENR. Application of RF to LENR electrochemical cells in the mid-1990s clearly showed increases in the production of excess power. More recently, RF have been measured in LENR cells. However, it is still possible that those data are artifacts of the operation of the system, and not indicative of LENR. It has been suggested that the appearance of RF in LENR experiments is the cause of LENR, and not merely a manifestation of such reactions. That possibility has significant implications. In the present paper, we summarize and analyze the results obtained by different research groups concerning the application and emission of RF in the kHz to GHz range associated with heat production during electrochemical loading of deuterium into palladium. c 2016 ISCMNS.

It was shown in after electrolysis period a strong heat flash with duration of 2-7 s and energy density of 60-100 J/cm2 was observed for Pd/PdO:D(H) sample placed in air atmosphere. The thermal energy of each flash was approximately 2-5 times higher than the energy supplied to the sample during electrolysis. Neutron- and γ-emissions accompanying the heat production have been investigated.', 'Charged Particle Emission during Electron Beam Excitation of Deuterium Subsystem in Pd and Ti- Deuteride Targets Energetic charged particle emissions accompanying deuterium desorption from specially prepared Pd/PdO:Dx and TiDx targets in vacuum, stimulated by electron beam (J ~ 0.6 mA/cm2, U = 30 keV) have been studied using a set of CR-39 plastic track detectors covered with various metal foil filters. It was found that the electron bombardment of those targets is caused by statistically significant emissions of DD-reaction product (3 MeV protons), as well as high energy alpha particles (11-20 MeV). At the same time the Pd/PdO:Dx and the TiDx samples show no sign of nuclear emissions during vacuum exposure without e-beam stimulation. Extrapolation of both the DD-reaction cross section and the enhancement factor (consistent with calculated screening potential U = 750 eV) e to very low deuteron energy allowed us to satisfactorily describe the detected DD- reaction yield in Pd/PdO:D target, assuming “hot” deuteron (E ~ 3.0 eV) x d generation under e-beam bombardment. This result strongly supports the theoretical prediction [1,2] with regards to electron excitation of the D- subsystem in Pd- deuterides', 'Charged Particle Emissions and Surface Morphology of Pd/PdO:Dx and TiD Targets Under Electron Beam Excitation We report charged particle emission from metal deuterides upon e-beam excitation of their surface. Detection and identification was made using CR-39 plastic track detectors with Cu and Al absorbers.

4,"['EXCESS HEAT PRODUCTION IN Pd/D DURING PERIODIC PULSE DISCHARGE CURRENT IN VARIOUS CONDITIONS Experimental data from low energy nuclear reactions (LERN) in condensed media are presented. The nuclear reactions products were found in solid cathode media used in glow discharge. Apparently, the nuclear reactions were initiated when bombarding the cathode surface by plasma ions with the energy of 1.0-2.0 keV. Excess heat from a high current glow discharge reaction in D , Xe and Kr using cathodes already charged 2 with preliminary deuterium-charged Pd and Ti cathode samples are given. Excess heat up to 10 - 15 W and efficiency up to 130% was recorded under the experiments for Pd cathode samples in D discharge. Excess 2 heat up to 5 W and efficiency up to 150% was recorded for Pd cathodes that were charged with deuterium before the run, in Xe and Kr discharges. At the same time excess heat was not observed for pure Pd cathode samples in Xe and Kr discharges. The formation of impurity nuclides (7Li, 13C, 15N, 20Ne, 29Si, 44Ca, 48Ca, 56Fe, 57Fe, 59Co, 64Zn, 66Zn, 75As, 107Ag, 109Ag, 110Cg, 111Cg, 112Cg, 114Cg, 115In) with the efficiency up to 1013 atoms/s was recorded. The isotopic ratios of these new nuclides was quite different from the natural ratios. Soft X-ray radiation from the solid-state cathode with the intensity up to 0.01Gy/s was recorded in experiments with discharges in H , D , Ar, Xe and Kr. The X-ray radiation was observed in bursts of up to 2 2 106 photons, with up to 105 bursts per second while the discharge was formed and within 100 ms after turning off the discharge current. The results of the X-ray radiation registration showed that the exited energy levels have a lifetime up to 100 ms or more, and the energy of 1.2 - 2.5 keV. A possible mechanism for producing excess heat and nuclear transmutation reactions in the solid medium with the exited energy levels is considered.', 'RESEARCH INTO CHARACTERISTICS OF X-RAY EMISSION LASER BEAMS FROM SOLID-STATE CATHODE MEDIUM OF HIGH-CURRENT GLOW DISCHARGE X-ray emissions ranging 1.2 – 3.0 keV with dose rate up to 1.0 Gy/s have been registered in experiments with high-current Glow Discharge. The emissions energy and intensity depend on the cathode material; the kind of plasma-forming gas; and the discharge parameters. The experiments were carried out on the high-current glow discharge device using D , H , Kr and Xe 2 2 at pressure up to 10 Torr, as well as cathode samples made from Al, Sc, Ti, Ni, Nb, Zr, Mo, Pd, Ta, W, Pt, at current up to 500 mA and discharge voltage of 500-2500 V. Two emission modes were revealed under the experiments: 1. Diffusion X-rays was observed as separate X-ray bursts (up to 5×105 bursts a second and up to 106 X-ray quanta in a burst); 2. X-rays in the form of laser microbeams (up to 104 beams a second and up to 1010 X-ray of quanta in a beam, angular divergence was up to 10-4, the duration of the separate laser beams must be τ =3·10-13 - 3·10-14 s, the separate beam power must be 107 – 108 W). The emission of the X-ray laser beams occurred when the discharge occurred and within 100 ms after turning off the current. The results of experimental research into the characteristics of secondary penetrating radiation occurring when interacting primary X-ray beams from a solid-state cathode medium with targets made of various materials are reported. It was shown that the secondary radiation consisted of fast electrons. Secondary radiation of two types was observed: 1. The emission with a continuous temporal spectrum in the form of separate bursts with intensity up to 106 fast electrons a burst. 2. The emission with a discrete temporal spectrum and emission rate up to 1010 fast electrons a burst. A third type of the penetrating radiation was observed as well. This type was recorded directly by the photomultiplier placed behind of the target without the scintillator. The abnormal high penetrating ability of this radiation type requires additional research to explain. The obtained results show that creating optically active medium with long-living metastable levels with the energy of 1.0 - 3.0 keV and more is possible in the solid state.']","['discharge current', 'rays', 'medium', 'laser', 'ray laser', 'bursts']"
