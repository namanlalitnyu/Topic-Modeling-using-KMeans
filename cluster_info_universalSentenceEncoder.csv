Lebedev Physics Institute, Moscow, Russia) represents an ion accelerator of light elements with atomic number in the range Z=1-54 with ion energies ranging from 0.5 to 50 keV operating at deuteron current densities up to 2 A/cm2 and intended to perform a wide spectrum of physical experiments related to LENR.', 'Integrated approach for high resolution surface characterization: coupling focused ion beam with micro and nano mechanical tests. In the present paper, we will give a brief overview about the synergic use of two high resolution techniques with focus on applications on thin coatings: Focused Ion Beam (coupled with electron beam) imaging, milling and deposition technique (briefly called FIB) and Nanoindentation. After a basic description of both techniques (architecture, probe-sample interaction basics and operation modes), we will demonstrate effectiveness of this approach for microstructural investigation on very small samples without any sample preparation or pre- processing by presenting two case studies: (i) Analysis of residual stresses of engineered surfaces by coupling focused ion beam controlled material removal and nanoindentation testing, and (ii) Nano-mechanical characterization of sputtered niobium thin films for application in accelerating cavities.', 'Charged Particle Emission during Electron Beam Excitation of Deuterium Subsystem in Pd and Ti- Deuteride Targets Energetic charged particle emissions accompanying deuterium desorption from specially prepared Pd/PdO:Dx and TiDx targets in vacuum, stimulated by electron beam (J ~ 0.6 mA/cm2, U = 30 keV) have been studied using a set of CR-39 plastic track detectors covered with various metal foil filters. It was found that the electron bombardment of those targets is caused by statistically significant emissions of DD-reaction product (3 MeV protons), as well as high energy alpha particles (11-20 MeV). At the same time the Pd/PdO:Dx and the TiDx samples show no sign of nuclear emissions during vacuum exposure without e-beam stimulation. Extrapolation of both the DD-reaction cross section and the enhancement factor (consistent with calculated screening potential U = 750 eV) e to very low deuteron energy allowed us to satisfactorily describe the detected DD- reaction yield in Pd/PdO:D target, assuming “hot” deuteron (E ~ 3.0 eV) x d generation under e-beam bombardment. This result strongly supports the theoretical prediction [1,2] with regards to electron excitation of the D- subsystem in Pd- deuterides']","['pdo', 'track', 'track diameter', 'detector', 'alpha', 'tidx']"
1,"['Electromagnetic Emission in the kHz to GHz Range Associated with Heat Production During Electrochemical Loading of Deuterium into Palladium: A Summary and Analysis of Results Obtained by Different Research Groups There is a small literature on the combination of low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) experiments and radiofrequencies (RF). The papers are worth attention in case they can teach anything about the mechanisms behind LENR. Application of RF to LENR electrochemical cells in the mid-1990s clearly showed increases in the production of excess power. More recently, RF have been measured in LENR cells. However, it is still possible that those data are artifacts of the operation of the system, and not indicative of LENR. It has been suggested that the appearance of RF in LENR experiments is the cause of LENR, and not merely a manifestation of such reactions. That possibility has significant implications. In the present paper, we summarize and analyze the results obtained by different research groups concerning the application and emission of RF in the kHz to GHz range associated with heat production during electrochemical loading of deuterium into palladium. c 2016 ISCMNS.

An elec- trolytic cell with a Ni cathode and a Pt anode with an aqueous (H2O not D2O) solution of K2CO3 as electrolyte was used for the experiment. A dc-power supply capable of supplying up to 5 A current was used to drive the electrolysis with the typical current being around 4 A and the applied voltage about 100 V. After running the electrolysis for about two weeks with a daily run time of 8 h on an average, a part of the nickel electrode, which by this time had become black, was taken for elemental analysis using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS analysis showed that a whole host of new elements had appeared on the cathode such as: K, Fe, Cu, O, Rh, Zr and Pb. The apparent concentration of the elements varied from just over a percent for K and Pb to about 10% for Rh and 20% for Cu. The sample was then taken to a Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (ToF-SIMS) for isotopic analysis. This analysis also showed that a set of new elements had appeared on the nickel wire which were: K, Si, Mg, Mn, Zn, O & Rh. The Ni itself was found to have the following isotopes: 58Ni, 60Ni and 62Ni with isotope concentration ratios differing significantly from the ratio found in naturally occurring Ni. It was clear that in the electrolyzed Ni the concentrations of 60Ni and 62Ni had gone down compared to the concentration of 58Ni. This is a clear indication that nuclear reactions had taken place during electrolysis. c 2017 ISCMNS. All rights reserved.

ISSN 2227-3123 "" Keywords: LENR, Surface, Theory, Transmutation, WKB approximation The Condensed Matter Nuclear Science has been studied for the last 26 years since the original work by Fleis- chmann and Pons [1]. While the cold fusion of two deuterium atom may be more important from the technological point of view, the transmutation reactions are scientifically more interesting. The existence of low energy transmutation reactions is intrinsically even more surprising than the cold (low energy) deuterium fusion, because the low tunneling probability (the Gamow factor) is supposed to suppress very effectively the transition rate with the increasing nuclear charge. In this note, transmutation reactions will be studied theoretically. In what follows we shall assume that there is some kind of mechanism, which greatly enhances the apparently small tunneling probability. We will not make any restrictive assumptions about the actual mechanism, except just assuming that the mechanism itself is independent of the nuclear charge Z.']","['frequencies', 'ghz', 'ni', 'cells', 'application', 'dwc']"
2,"['Nickel Transmutation and Excess Heat Model using Reversible Thermodynamics This research develops the Least Action Nuclear Process (LANP) model of cold fusion, by assuming that the process is thermody- namically reversible. This requires: (1) one element of new physical theory, a far-from-equilibrium black body equation having a second temperature scale and (2) a nuclear reaction selection method based on the Principle of Least Action. The model appears to predict nuclear transmutations observed in Miley’s nickel microspheres, without false positives, and provides a plausible explanation of loading and ignition processes, excess heat, no excess heat, and the absence of gamma radiation. The model shows how solar core temperatures can exist in a laboratory temperature device. This presentation is abstracted from a larger technical paper. © 2014 ISCMNS. All rights reserved.

Examples are given from a set of 26 intentionally similar current ramps which show three distinct Modes of loading performance: Mode A - a linear decrease of Pd resistance, beyond the resistance maximum, with logarithmic increase in electrochemical current; Mode B -an initial log-linear decrease on the Mode A trajectory, followed by a rapid increase in resistance when the resistance falls below a critical value; Mode C - a shallow decrease in resistance with approximately symmetric increase as the [log] current density is increased beyond a threshold value similar to that for Mode B. Mode A is most frequently associated with the appearance of calorimetrically determined excess heat.', 'EFFECT OF BORON FOR THE HEAT PRODUCTION AT THE HEAVY WATER ELECTROLYSIS USING PALLADIUM CATHODE The heat balance during the electrolysis of lM LiOD heavy water solution using Pd calhlxle has been measured using the 0ow calorimeter with the constant power supply and the thermochemically closed cell.

3,"['Upper Bound in the Fusion Products and Transmutation Enhancement in Alloys Significant elemental transmutations occur on cathodes comprised of either pure metals (Ni, Cu) or the alloys Kanthal (Fe Cr Al ) and Ni-Fe (Ni Fe ) in light water electrolysis highly biased (~30 V) against a pure graphite anode. The 0.74 0.21 0.05 0.93 0.07 utilization of graphite as an anode is advantageous because it avoids anode-driven contamination and establishes a distinct upper bound in the fusion products (Cu), which is different from upper bounds in previous studies (Pb or Ag) with a Pt anode. Whenever isotopic shifts were measured following transmutation, they differed from the natural ratios. Pure Ni cathode predominantly trans- mutes to Fe and Cu, pure Cu cathode transmutes to Fe and Mg, Kanthal shows the appearance of Cu and Mg and the Ni-Fe alloy transmutes to Mg and Cu. While the extent of transmutation in pure cathodes is a few tens of percent after about twelve hours of Cathodic Hydrogen Loading (CHL), Kanthal and Ni-Fe alloy show comparable or larger amounts of transmutations in less than an hour of CHL. © 2022 ICCF.

4,"['RESEARCH INTO CHARACTERISTICS OF X-RAY EMISSION LASER BEAMS FROM SOLID-STATE CATHODE MEDIUM OF HIGH-CURRENT GLOW DISCHARGE X-ray emissions ranging 1.2 – 3.0 keV with dose rate up to 1.0 Gy/s have been registered in experiments with high-current Glow Discharge. The emissions energy and intensity depend on the cathode material; the kind of plasma-forming gas; and the discharge parameters. The experiments were carried out on the high-current glow discharge device using D , H , Kr and Xe 2 2 at pressure up to 10 Torr, as well as cathode samples made from Al, Sc, Ti, Ni, Nb, Zr, Mo, Pd, Ta, W, Pt, at current up to 500 mA and discharge voltage of 500-2500 V. Two emission modes were revealed under the experiments: 1. Diffusion X-rays was observed as separate X-ray bursts (up to 5×105 bursts a second and up to 106 X-ray quanta in a burst); 2. X-rays in the form of laser microbeams (up to 104 beams a second and up to 1010 X-ray of quanta in a beam, angular divergence was up to 10-4, the duration of the separate laser beams must be τ =3·10-13 - 3·10-14 s, the separate beam power must be 107 – 108 W). The emission of the X-ray laser beams occurred when the discharge occurred and within 100 ms after turning off the current. The results of experimental research into the characteristics of secondary penetrating radiation occurring when interacting primary X-ray beams from a solid-state cathode medium with targets made of various materials are reported. It was shown that the secondary radiation consisted of fast electrons. Secondary radiation of two types was observed: 1. The emission with a continuous temporal spectrum in the form of separate bursts with intensity up to 106 fast electrons a burst. 2. The emission with a discrete temporal spectrum and emission rate up to 1010 fast electrons a burst. A third type of the penetrating radiation was observed as well. This type was recorded directly by the photomultiplier placed behind of the target without the scintillator. The abnormal high penetrating ability of this radiation type requires additional research to explain. The obtained results show that creating optically active medium with long-living metastable levels with the energy of 1.0 - 3.0 keV and more is possible in the solid state.', 'Generation of Heat and Products During Plasma Electrolysis Direct decomposition of water is very difficult in normal conditions. Hydrogen gas can be usually obtained by electrolysis or by a pyrolysis reaction at high temperatures, starting at approximately 3700ºC. However, as we have already reported, anomalous heat generation can occur during plasma electrolysis, and this process makes it rather easy to achieve both electrolysis and pyrolysis simultaneously. In this paper we describe anomalous amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gas generated during plasma electrolysis. The generation of hydrogen far in excess of amounts predicted by Faraday’s law is continuously observed when conditions such as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. Non-Faraday generation of hydrogen gas sometimes produces more than 80 times as much hydrogen as normal electrolysis does. Unfortunately there have been few claimed replications of excess hydrogen, even in rare cases in which excess heat is claimed. In most cases, no excess heat or hydrogen is observed. The reaction products found after electrolysis were different after excess heat generation.

During the plasma electrolysis large amounts of heat are sometimes generated. The heat can exceed input substantially, in some cases by up to 200 percent of input power. At the same time, anomalous elements are detected in the electrolyte and on the electrode surface. Based on the heat and the product, we hypothesize a nuclear reaction can be induced by photon activation on the cathode element.']","['discharge', 'plasma electrolysis', 'input voltage', 'laser', 'glow discharge', 'glow']"
5,"['Is the Abundance of Elements in Earth’s Crust Correlated with LENR Transmutation Rates? Nuclear transmutations are reported in many low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) experiments. We showed in a previous study (Scholkmann and Nagel, J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. 13 (2014) 485–494) that (i) the transmutation data of three independent experiments have a similar pattern and (ii) this pattern correlates with a model-based on the prediction of Widom and Larsen (WL). In the present study, we extended our analysis and investigated whether the abundance of elements in Earth’s crust is correlated with either (i) the WL-prediction, or (ii) the three LENR transmutation data sets. The first analysis revealed that there is no statistically significant correlation between these variables. The second analysis showed a significant correlation, but the correlation only reflects the trend of the data and not the peak-like pattern. This result strengthens the interpretation that the observed peak-like pattern in the transmutation data sets does not originate from contamination. Further implications of our study are discussed and a recommendation is given for future transmutation experiments. c 2016 ISCMNS. All rights reserved.

Correlations between the material status and the occurrence of the effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. Although during the last two decades, in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producing the excess power is not completely understood. So far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clear explanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required to define the effect. Recently, In order to improve this aspect of this research, specific work has been carried out to investigate whether the excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of Radio Frequency from the active cathode. Suitable probes and triggering included in the RF experimental system revealed RF signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladium samples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and RF signal emission was found. The preliminary results highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, and the importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems. c 2016 ISCMNS.
